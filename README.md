arduino_morse_code
==================

Translating messages into led flashes on an Arduino board

the file morse_code.ino should be placed in a folder called morse_code for it to work with the Arduino IDE

Extending: 
1. Accept and translate messages input by user
2. Use an array of LEDs, and flash one character per LED (i.e., first character's dots and dashes flash on first LED, second character's on second, etc. then comes back to first when that word has ended)
