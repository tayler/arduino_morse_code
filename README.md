==================

Translating messages into led flashes on an Arduino board

Extending: 
1. Accept and translate messages input by user
2. Use an array of LEDs, and flash one character per LED (i.e., first character's dots and dashes flash on first LED, second character's on second, etc. then comes back to first when that word has ended)
